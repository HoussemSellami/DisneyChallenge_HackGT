# DisneyChallenge_HackGT
Results of the challenge proposed by Disney at HackGT 2019

Overall description: 

This project consists in the use of a deep neural networks architechture called Generative Adversarial Networks, that will be trained using Disney characters as inputs (training data set) in order to create an automatic way of producing sketches of new non-existing characters that could be use to inspire the art designers when they have to come up with a new idea for a character.

The source code of the GAN was obtained from a public GitHub repository: https://github.com/llSourcell/Pokemon_GAN/blob/master/pokeGAN.pyw.
